# python-video-server

Toy python/flask project intended as an experiment.

The app finds appropriate video files and exposes them in a coherent way, with
a list navigation, player manipulation controls and a way to play file formats
not supported by the browser.

# Inspired by:

1. Player interface of online courses sites.
2. Omni-format-filesystem - idea of telpeloth - keeping media in original
    format, but with means to convert others on request

# Why?

Because I can :)
The interface based on HTML provides flexibility and can include other media easily.
Given that some courses allow downloading their video materials, it just makes sense
to have a way to browse and watch it offline or in LAN.
