== TODOs ==
* look for cached converted files on list page load to indicate which ones are ready
* after file has been converted, it should be shown on the list that it's ready to play
* allow file to be sent before the convertion finishes (is it even possible?)
* add config option to replace original files with converted ones
  * this option might be done per course in course.md file or some yaml config
